# Department of Corrections project

This repo contains some exploratory work and preliminary modeling
of data from Philadelphia Department of Corrections (DOC) on 
incarcerated person releases throughout Philadelphia from 2007 - 2016.
The work is done in collaboration with 
[Nina Johnson](https://www.swarthmore.edu/profile/nina-johnson) 
and her research group and is strictly in a volunteer
data scientist capacity.

For an overview of the data, including descriptive statistics and 
some visualizations, check out [doc_data_overview.md](https://github.com/ericoh17/doc_project/blob/master/doc_data_overview.md).

See [doc_car_model.md](https://github.com/ericoh17/doc_project/blob/master/doc_car_model.md) for 
a description of the Bayesian spatial model.
