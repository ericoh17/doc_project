DOC CAR model

We noticed in [doc\_data\_overview.md](https://github.com/ericoh17/doc_project/blob/master/doc_data_overview.md) that there was evidence of spatial correlation in number of releases between neighboring zip codes through Philadelphia. Accounting for this spatial correlation is the focus of the current modeling work.

One of the standard statistics used to assess the strength of this spatial correlation is Moran's *I*, which is defined as

$$
I = \\frac{n}{\\sum\_i \\sum\_j w\_{ij}}\\frac{\\sum\_i \\sum\_j w\_{ij}(X\_i-\\bar{X})(X\_j-\\bar{X})}{\\sum\_i (X\_i-\\bar{X})^2}
$$
 where
*w*<sub>*i**j*</sub>
 is 1 if zip codes i and j share a border and 0 otherwise.

    Moran I statistic standard deviate = 4.716, p-value = 0.000001203
    alternative hypothesis: greater
    sample estimates:
    Moran I statistic       Expectation          Variance 
          0.387804709      -0.021276596       0.007524396 

We can use Moran's I to perform testing for spatial correlation under the null hypothesis that there is no spatial correlation. Calculating Moran's I on the total number of releases in each zip code from 2007 - 2016 yields a statistic of 0.3878, compared to a null mean of âˆ’0.0213 and standard error of 0.0075, suggesting a high amount of spatial correlation in the number of releases between zip codes.

Counts of incarcerated person releases
======================================

Discuss the outliers with huge number of releases. Model on log scale

Also, some zip codes in some years have 0 counts, meaning we have to handle this using inverse hyperbolic sine transformation?

Interpret as percent changes in releases.

Zip code level predictors
=========================

To account for zip code level covariates, we merge the DOC data with the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, containing information about poverty and income levels for Census tract groups. For more detail on how this was done, see [link\_doc\_census.R](https://github.com/ericoh17/doc_project/blob/master/link_doc_census.R).

CAR priors to account for spatial correlation

Conditional autoregressive (CAR) priors
